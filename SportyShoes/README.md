# Make an E-commerce Website for Sporty Shoes .

## Project 1 

## DESCRIPTION

## Project objective:

As a Full Stack Developer, complete the features of the application by planning the development and pushing the source code to the GitHub repository. 
      

## Background of the problem statement:

Sporty Shoes is a company that manufactures and sells sports shoes. They have a walk-in store, and now, they wish to launch their e-commerce portal sportyshoes.com.

 

You're asked to develop a prototype of the application. It will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you are asked to do the following: 

 *  Presenting the specification document which has the productâ€™s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions
 *  Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 
 *  Explaining the Java concepts used in the project 
 *  Discussing the generic features of the product:
 *  There will be an admin to manage the website. An administrator login will be required to access the admin page. 

 

The admin should be able to change his password if he wants, he should be able to:

 *  Manage the products in the store including categorizing them
 *  Browse the list of users who have signed up and be able to search users
 *  See purchase reports filtered by date and category

## Additional Requirements

 * The front end can be largely text (unless you otherwise desire), and there is no need for anything more than the minimal html/javascript/css as we will 
   be covering that content in the next phase.
 * Authentication can be enforced in any way you choose, and there is no requirement to strictly enforce security requirements. You can use Spring Security 
   for authentication if desired but it's not required.
 * I recommend that users be given a view to browse products and make "orders."  However, there is no need to implmement payment/etc.  A "order" could be
   as simple as a "one-click" button next to the product that would generate an order. Things like shipping/etc are out of the scope for the prototype. 
   Complex order management like cancellation/etc is not required.
 

 


## Notes

I have a [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) document of what we had done in class to get started on this.
