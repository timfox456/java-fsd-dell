# Getting Started

This is a document on what we did to get started in the course.

This is *NOT* prescriptive. These are merely suggestions to get started and not in any way 
to be inferred as requirements for the project.


## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repo under your account.

If you don't already have a github repo, create one for this project. I actually recommend that you have a special repo
just for this project, but if you choose to combine it with other things from this class that should be ok as long as
its clear where you work from Sporty Shoes is.

## Step 2:  Create a Spring Initializer.

You can create as follows.  

Please note there are two modules you may want to consider:
1. Thymeleaf -- if you prefer thymeleaf views to JSPs.  Please see the SpringStarter project.
2. Spring Security -- Spring Security is rather complex but does have a lot of features around authentication and security.

Go ahead and unzip the SportyShoes.zip and put it in your git repository.
